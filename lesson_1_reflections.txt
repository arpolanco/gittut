How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By viewing the differences I was able to spot slight code differences like
    a sore thumb andnoticed the typo of "space"

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By being able to go to a specific portion of code as a file evolves and
    develops during the course of its lifetime having previous versions to go off
    of is essential to correct potential mistakes that may have gone undiscovered.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros is that if you are writing spaghetti code to get your thoughts and 
    hopefully implement a quick test you can without needing to save to the file
	Cons if you dont save you get dunked.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Orgnaization mostly

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is for looking at the revisions of a file over time 
	git diff is comparing two different files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back in time

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    just trying to do work bruh.
